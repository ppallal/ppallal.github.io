I interned at Commvault Systems from January 2015 to June 2015 as a _Software Development Engineer_


Developed a tool to reduce the build time of the product. The tool analyses the source code in C++, and the pdb files generated during compilation time to derive a variable level dependency tree. I contributed to Commvault's flagship product Simpana, through a module that backs up virtual machines with a UNIX based guest OS.
