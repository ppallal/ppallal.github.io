As a student as PESIT, I Developed a sorting algorithm â€“ Look Aside Sort, which performs better than quicksort and merge sort in most cases. The algorithm had a theoretical time complexity of n in the best case and n2 in the worst case.

This project was developed alongside my Analyssi and Design of Algorithm class.
