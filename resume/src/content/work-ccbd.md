I interned at Cloud Computing and Big Data Center in PESIT from June 2013 to July 2014.

__CCBD__ is a domain canter for cloud computing and big data projects within PESIT.
Designed the architecture and structure of a secure system which would enable Openstack to Openstack federation. This would mean that two or more Openstack clouds would now operate in a hybrid manner sharing the load across each other, with the right access control and security across each of them. The research paper on this was published in 8th International Conference for Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (ICITST-2013)(IEEE) in London, UK and appeared in Journal of Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (JITST), Volume 3, Issues 3/4, ISSN 2046-3723 (Online).
