I have worked at Amagi Media Labs since July 2015 as a _Software Development Engineer_

1. Branching with pruning to solve ad scheduling: Designed algorithms to schedule advertisements and optimize the profit. One national ad spot (from a single broadcast) is shared in multiple regions which would play different ads. Each region has ads duration to be played in the same time as the national spot. Lot more constraints like limit on national ad spot durations, ability to drop an add, and may more to be considered. This was an NP-Hard problem. A combinatorial method with branching and pruning was used as the base. Many speed up techniques and pruning techniques were a part of the algorithm.

2. Twisting and turning knapsack to solve ad scheduling: Designed an algorithm involving multiple multidimensional knapsacks to optimise with multi-way decision engine and backtracking in selection of schedule to solve the problem mentioned above.

3. Using column generation to solve scheduling of ads: Designed an algorithm based on column generation approach normally used to solve the cutting stock problem. The above problem is remodelled into a pattern based problem and the constraints are handled as a sub problem.
