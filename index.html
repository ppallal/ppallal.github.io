                  Amagi Media Labs is a media technology startup that brings targeted advertisements on television
                  and OTT media. Here, I am part of the ‘Ad Tech’ team, focusing on solving business problems related to ads
                  such as scheduling, dynamic pricing, e-commerce for ads, ad statistics and lifecycle among other things. I built
                  the scheduling engine to optimize the ad playout. I designed and implemented algorithmic modules to solve
                  many np-hard category problems. I developed the infrastructure backend, contributed to web backend and UI
                  as well. A web application to sell our ads to the customer, much like an <a href="http://www.amagi.com/adnetworks/my-media-plan/">e-commerce site</a>
                   was another major product I worked on, for which I
